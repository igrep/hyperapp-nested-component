# hyperapp-nested-component

Port [Example of Sibling/Nested component communication in elm](https://github.com/afcastano/elm-nested-component-communication) to [Hyperapp](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp/) to show how to build hyperapp apps with nested components without a function equivalent to `Html.map` in Elm.

## How to build

```bash
npm i
make
```

## Run without cloning and building the project
